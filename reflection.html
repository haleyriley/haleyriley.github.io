      <h1>Reflection Assignment Project 2</h1>
<br>
<p>
      The website I chose to redo for this project is 88.8 Fim & Photography’s portfolio website. I think the brand and website both could use some character and personality.  I don’t think it stands out from any other film or photography site and lacks visual direction.
<br><br>
      On the homepage, I chose to highlight Jordan’s photo series “Blowface” with a photo slide. I think the photos are fun and quirky and are representative of who Jordan is as a person.  The navigation bar is located on the side, and there is a client portal that can be found on the bottom of the home page. The client portal is for clients to access their photo sets, and does not need to be showcased throughout the website, other than on the front page.
<br><br>
      I organized everything in a way that doesn’t require a bunch of scrolling.  I don’t think that continuously scrolling websites are very user friendly or intuitive. I set up the navigation so it’s easy to find what you are looking for, and helps the user navigate through Jordan’s portfolio without having to wonder what or where to click next.
<br><br>
      I separated the photography and videography sets on the updated website. On his old website, all photography and videography was together.  Being separated, it helps the user easily navigate to the type of work that they are interested in viewing, and also quickly showcases his diverse talents.
<br><br>
      I am happy with how it turned out overall.  I am having trouble with grid responsiveness and image size distortion in the image galleries. I am also not going to have all images and videos in place by the end of this class.  I hope to continue to work on this after this class to fix these problems.
